I love coding in python. I've been using it for a while now, and it's a great way to learn a new programming language.

I'm going to show you how to create a simple web application using Flask. Flask is a web framework for Python. It's very easy to get started with it, but it can be a bit intimidating at first. If you're new to web development, you might want to check out my previous post on the basics of Flask, which will give you a good idea of what to expect when you start using the framework. In this post, I'll walk you through the process of setting up a basic Flask application, so that you can get a feel for how it works and what's going on under the hood. You'll also learn about some of the more advanced features that Flask has to offer, such as authentication and routing. This post will be written in Python 3.3.2, although you should be able to follow along with Python 2.7 if you have it installed on your system. The code for this tutorial is available on GitHub.


Step 1: Install Flask¶ The first thing you'll need to do is install Flask and its dependencies. To do this, run the following command in your terminal: $ pip install -r requirements.txt You should now have a working Flask installation. Next, let's create our first Flask app. Create a file called index.py in the same directory as your Flask project. Here's what it should look like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191
